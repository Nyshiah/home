    <p> This is a paragragh</p>
    <p>A paragragh can be "broken" with the [br] element,
    <br> which you can see in this sentence. This are called "Line Breaks"
    <br>and makes a (gap?) after sentences.</p>

    <p>Here is a link to the Website that is helping me code:</p>

     title="A good learning site"

     href="https://www.w3schools.com/">W3schools</a>

        I saw you, standing there,
        With a face that none can compare.
        It was love at first sight
        Blissful! What a delight!
        The emotions racing through my head
        Nearly landed me on my deathbed.

        Like the rainbow up in the sky
        I gaze upon your face for hours at a time.
        Though facinated by what I see
        I know, that it could never be
        Then, a sudden emotion took over.
        What is this? I wonder.
        
        Oh this agony in my heart
        Knowing that we'll forever be apart
        With your love belonging elsewhere
        I can olny watch and stare
        This pain will sureley eat me out 
        Until the day i finally shout

        But the days pass by and you're nowhere to be seen
        I search day and night wondering where you been
        Neither at your residence nor at the school

          <b><em>My eyes still long for your face</em></b>  </p>
